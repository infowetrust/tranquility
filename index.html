            <p class='intro__credit'><b>By RJ ANDREWS.</b> JULY 2019</p>
			<p class='intro__dek'>
                    <br>After four days of travel and a daring landing, Apollo&nbsp;11’s Lunar Module <i>Eagle</i> touched down on the Moon. Six hours later the hatch opened. <span class="n">&nbsp;NEIL&nbsp;ARMSTRONG&nbsp;</span> and <span class="b">&nbsp;BUZZ&nbsp;ALDRIN&nbsp;</span> emerged. They spent the following two and a half hours exploring an area the size of a baseball diamond.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is the story—told through highlights from the original transmission log, illustrated photographs and maps, and a timeline at the bottom of your screen—about what happened on their Moonwalk.<br>
                    <br>

                    By the end of their walk, Neil and Buzz collected 48 pounds of rocks and soil, made geologic observations, deployed experiments, shot photographs, received a phonecall from President Nixon, and inspected the condition of the spacecraft that would soon blast them back to Michael Collins.<br><br>
                    But first Neil & Buzz needed rest. They stayed on the moon for one night to sleep. Neil slung a makeshift harness and Buzz curled up beneath him on the floor. With glaring lights and cold suits, only Buzz was able to doze off for a little bit.<br><br>
