			<p class='intro__dek'>
                    <br>After four days of travel and a daring landing, Apollo&nbsp;11’s Lunar Module <i>Eagle</i> touched down on the Moon. Six hours later the hatch opened. For the next 2.5 hours astronauts <span class="n">&nbsp;NEIL&nbsp;ARMSTRONG&nbsp;</span> and <span class="b">&nbsp;BUZZ&nbsp;ALDRIN&nbsp;</span> explored an area the size of a baseball diamond.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is the story about what happened on that 1969 Moonwalk, told with highlights from the original transmission log. Scroll to see the adventure.<br>

                        <p>By the end of their walk, Neil and Buzz collected 48 pounds of rocks and soil, made geologic observations, deployed experiments, shot photographs, received a phonecall from President&nbsp;Nixon, and inspected the condition of the spacecraft that would soon blast them back to Michael&nbsp;Collins.<br>

                        But first Neil and Buzz needed rest. They stayed on the moon for one night to sleep. Neil slung a makeshift harness and Buzz curled up beneath him on the floor. Glaring lights, blaring alarms, and cold suits prevented Neil from sleeping. Buzz dozed off for only a little bit.<br><br></p>

                            <p>This project was motivated by the realization that I had no idea what happened on the Apollo&nbsp;11 Moonwalk beyond Neil's <i>ONE SMALL STEP</i> and that iconic flag shot. How long were they out there? How far did they explore? What exactly did they do. To answer these questions a wealth of resources were brought together. While superficially hand illusterated, the project's chief planning documents include a 3D model, layered map, and detailed timeline of the Moonwalk. Read the <a href="https://infowetrust.com/tranquility-design" target="_blank">design essay</a> to learn more about the making of this data story. <i>-RJ</i></p><br>
